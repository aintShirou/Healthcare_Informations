            <h2> Electronic Health Records</h2>
            <img src="./img/electronic-medical-records.jpg" class="ehrimg">
            <p>An electronic health record (EHR) is a digital version of a patient’s paper chart. EHRs are real-time, patient-centered records that make information available instantly and securely to authorized users. While an EHR does contain the medical and treatment histories of patients, an EHR system is built to go beyond standard clinical data collected in a provider’s office and can be inclusive of a broader view of a patient’s care.</p> 
            <p>EHRs are a vital part of health IT and can:
                <br>Contain a patient’s medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory and test results
                <br>Allow access to evidence-based tools that providers can use to make decisions about a patient’s care
                <br>Automate and streamline provider workflow
                <br>Patient registration, billing, preventive screenings, or checkups
                <br>Patient appointment and scheduling
                <br>Tracking patient data over time
                <br>Monitoring and improving overall quality of care

            <h2>Clinical Decision Support Systems </h2>
            <p>A clinical decision support system (CDSS) is intended to improve healthcare delivery by enhancing medical decisions with targeted clinical knowledge, patient information, and other health information. A traditional CDSS is comprised of software designed to be a direct aid to clinical-decision making, in which the characteristics of an individual patient are matched to a computerized clinical knowledge base and patient-specific assessments or recommendations are then presented to the clinician for a decision.CDSSs today are primarily used at the point-of-care, for the clinician to combine their knowledge with information or suggestions provided by the CDSS</p>

            <p>CDSSs have been classified and subdivided into various categories and types, including intervention timing, and whether they have active or passive delivery. CDSS are frequently classified as knowledge-based or non-knowledge based. In knowledge-based systems, rules (IF-THEN statements) are created, with the system retrieving data to evaluate the rule, and producing an action or output7; Rules can be made using literature-based, practice-based, or patient-directed evidence. CDSS that are non-knowledge based still require a data source, but the decision leverages artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), or statistical pattern recognition, rather than being programmed to follow expert medical knowledge.Non-knowledge based CDSS, although a rapidly growing use case for AI in medicine, are rife with challenges including problems understanding the logic that AI uses to produce recommendations (black boxes), and problems with data availability.They have yet to reach widespread implementation. Both types of CDSS have common components with subtle differences, illustrated below: </p>

            <h2>Picture archiving and Communication System </h2>
            <p>Picture archiving and communication system (PACS) is a modality of imaging technology which helps in image transmission from the site of image acquisition to multiple physically-disparate locations. This technology not only is economical (film-less department), but also convenient to access multiple modalities (radiographs, CT, MR, ultrasound etc.) simultaneously at multiple locations within hospitals or across the globe.</p>

            <p>The major components in the PACS workflow domain include acquisition; transfer to a central repository, with appropriate archiving; remote access for viewing; reporting; support in clinical decision-making (as with surgical planning); billing; and accounting; etc. All these components have to be supported by a robust and secure network, which is the backbone of the PACS.</p>
            <p> PACS is usually an integration of:
                <br>Input from digital or digitized analog devices, which may be any radiological modality e.g. x-ray, CT, MRI or ultrasound
                <br>Image acquisition device
                <br>Image storage device/server for short or long-term storage of data
                <br>Transmission network: local area network (within a building, office, department or campus) or wide area network (across a geographical area or around the world)
                <br>Display stations: imaging workstation and user interface
                <br>Camera: to convert into hard-copy images on need basis
